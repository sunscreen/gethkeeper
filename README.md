# gethkeeper

A program for pool operators that talks to ethereum based IPC's and unlocks your account securely

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Hopefully the installer gets every thing
```
NodeJS 8.9.x
```

### Installing
``
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunscreen/gethkeeper/master/setup.sh | bash
``
<br />
``
Presently the code is setup for Akroma (https://Akroma.io/) and can not be changed without editing the installer and source code directly ... we will work on some functionality for this
``
<br />
``
If all goes well binary called `account_unlock` will be created inside /home/Youruser/account_unlocker1.0/
``

## Usage

```
./account-unlock -dec <rpcport> .. run this how you please
./account-unlock -enc <rpcport> .. only really needed in the installer
./account-unlock -regeniv <iv> .. Work in progress

```
