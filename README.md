# gethkeeper

Gethkeeper is a program designed for pool operators and is in production on UnityMines, current build is currently running on our Akroma pool located at http://server2/unitystreams.com/dist/  <br />

Gethkeeper can talk to any ethereum based IPC's that supports account_unlocking.  </br >

Gethkeeper attempts to keep your pool's wallet password relatively safe and provides you the convenience of automating all pool payouts in convience and without any operational down down.

Gethkeeper aims to unlock your ether based account securely via Web3 IPC. <br />

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Hopefully the installer gets every thing
```
NodeJS 8.9.x
```

### Installing
``
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunscreen/gethkeeper/master/setup.sh | bash

<br />

Presently the code is setup for Akroma Coin (https://Akroma.io/) and can not be changed without editing the installer and source code directly ... we will work on some functionality for this

<br />

If all goes well binary called `account_unlock` will be created inside /home/Youruser/account_unlocker1.0/
``

## Usage

```
./account-unlock -dec <rpcport> .. run this how you please
./account-unlock -enc <rpcport> .. only really needed in the installer
./account-unlock -regeniv <iv> .. Work in progress

```
